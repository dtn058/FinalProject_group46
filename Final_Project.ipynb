When sifting through the datasets, we found that many of these categories had many observations, though some were lacking in observations and interest. The category we chose, How-to and Style was enticing because it concerned itself with clickbait, creativity, and the creator’s skill.\n"

        "* Why did we choose to use How To & Style category \n",
        " * There were many factors that we put into selecting this category. As we were sifting through the many categories with many observations in our dataset(1000+), we found that a lot of them were just uninteresting (News and Politics) or required a certain amount of prestige (Entertainment, in the case of it being filled with movie trailers). Therefore, we narrowed it down into How To & Style because it revolved around the creativity of the content creator (what kind of nifty tools they could make out of household products, etc). As such, this category would require certain levels of creativity and skill to thrive, but will clickbait offset this?\n",
